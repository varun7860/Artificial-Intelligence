Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a simulation of human intelligence in machines with the help of complex algorithms. These machines
are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The Artificial Intelligence is classified into 3 main types:
1. `Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI-Weak AI)` : ANI is a kind of AI which doesn't which uses AI in solving specific and simple tasks. Like humans 
   this weak AI doesn't have consciousness and strong reasoning skills. All kinds of AI that we see in our day to day life is weak AI. Some examples
   of weak AI are Alexa, Google search Engine and Self-Driving Cars.
2. `Artificial General Intelligence(AGI- Strong AI)` : AGI is a kind of AI which is has capabilities similar to humans.This strong AI would be able to do
   all kinds of tasks that human beings can. Till now there no such machine developed which can be said as an example of artificial artificial 
   general intelligence. One very close example to AGI is Sophia the humanoid. Although she can't be fully considered as an example of AGI, she can
   do many task which a human can like drawing, singing, talking and understanding human speech.
3. `Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI- Super AI)` : ASI is a kind of AI which surpasses the capabilities of human beings. In this type the machines
   will do tasks better than humans by making humans obsolete.Some examples of this type of AI are Terminator, Transformers, and doraemon.
